# Random-Stuff-Mod

The Random Stuff Mod is a mod that I am working on in my free time. There really is no set theme. I add whatever.
This mod is to help keep my programming skills up while also adding to my portfolio. 
I decided to make a mod for Minecraft since it's a game I have played for almost a decade now, and since I primarily code in Java, it was
a nice fit.

Updates are not guaranteed, since this is done in my free time, there will be periods of time where there may be many updates, or
larger updates, then when I don't have free time, there may be less and smaller updates. If anyone wishes to become a part of this mod,
email me at david@faidedtech.com. (Java Programming experience required)

Updates to this mod may break worlds. Since this mod can rapidly change. I will try to warn users beforehand, however, it is still
important to backup all worlds before performing any kinds of updates to either this mod, forge, or minecraft itself.

I am not responsible for any broken worlds, games, etc. I test the mod to ensure it works with a new world.
Backup any world before you launch it with this mod installed. 
I do not guarantee that this mod will work with other mods. I try during development to make sure it would, but I can't say for sure
since I do not test the mod with other mods. 

With that said, ModPack creators are allowed to use this mod in any modpack, but I require credits to be given and a link to either the
GitHub page or Downloads page for this mod.
I also do not permit others to upload the mod to other sites without authorization. If you want me to put my mod on your site, please email
david@faidedtech.com. 

Please report any bugs to the GitHub. To report unauthorized use, or postings, of the mod, please email david@faidedtech.com

All code is available to view at github.com/David5886/Random-Stuff-Mod

Textures were mostly made by RCXCrafter for use in this mod.
